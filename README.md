My first c# project, contains a LOT of bad code and rude errors, casue i dunno how to deal some things in other way, or just too lazy to recode this =) 
A lot of code pieces finded and copied from open sources in the net. If any autors find their code, i can add their names here, if someone cares about.
Dont waste time to check this, its just a saved code to some cases. Or, leave a comment, i'll gladly read this someday)
