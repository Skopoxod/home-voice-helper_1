# home-voice-helper_1
Voice helper for home automatisation
Start programs with voice, plus some things like a alarm clock or weather check.

My first c# project, contains a LOT of bad code, casue i dunno how to deal some things in other way. Many code pieces finded and copied from open sources in the net. If any autors find their code, i can add their names here, if someone cares about.
